# Phone-Price-Predictor
This project was created for the sole purpose of trying to decode the ideal price of a phone given a specific set of features it has. This algorithm has various uses, for example, it can be used for determining the price category of an upcoming smartphone, based on its leaked features, or can help a smartphone startup determine what price the business must price their smartphones for or heck even try to find out if you, as the user had been scammed for the phone you currently own right now!!! This is a relatively simple algorithm focused more on the explanation side as I start my journey to broadcast all my projects for a free download for any user to use. Anyways lets begin!!!
